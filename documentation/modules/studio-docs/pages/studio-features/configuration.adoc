== Overview

The Studio configuration page allows administrators to control global Studio behavior.

=== How to Access

The configuration is accessed through the App Management system:

. Go to *Administration > Apps management*
. Find the **Studio** application card or row
. Click btn:[Configure] (available only when the Studio app is installed)

The configuration form cannot be deleted, duplicated, or created manually -- only one configuration record exists per application instance.

== Configuration Options

The configuration form provides the following settings:

=== Enable Studio App (1)

* **Field**: `enableStudioApp`
* **Type**: Boolean switch
* **Default**: `true`

When enabled, the *Studio App* feature is active. This has the following effects on the application:

* The **StudioApp** field appears on all Studio component forms (models, fields, menus, actions, selections, charts, dashboards), allowing you to group components under a specific Studio App.
* The **Apps** menu entry under *App > Configuration > Apps* is visible.
* The **App Loaders** menu entry under *App > Configuration > App Loaders* is visible.
* Grid views for models, fields, and other components display the StudioApp column and allow grouping by app.

When disabled:

* The StudioApp field is hidden across all Studio forms and grids.
* The Apps and App Loaders menu entries are hidden from the Configuration sub-menu.
* All Studio components are managed without App grouping.

[TIP]
====
Disable this option if you do not need to package customizations into separate applications. This simplifies the interface by removing the StudioApp field from all forms.
====

=== Enable Track Web Service Call (2)

* **Field**: `enableTrackWebServiceCall`
* **Type**: Boolean switch
* **Default**: `false`

When enabled, web service calls made through the WS Connector are tracked and logged for debugging and auditing purposes.

[NOTE]
====
Enabling web service call tracking may impact performance in high-volume environments. Enable this option primarily for debugging or auditing purposes.

== Technical Details

The configuration is stored in the `AppStudio` entity (`com.axelor.studio.db.AppStudio`), which has a one-to-one relationship with the base `App` entity.

|===
| Field | Type | Default | Description

| `enableStudioApp`
| Boolean
| `true`
| Controls visibility of StudioApp grouping across the Studio UI

| `enableTrackWebServiceCall`
| Boolean
| `false`
| Enables logging of WS Connector calls
|===

The `enableStudioApp` setting is read by all Studio views via the configuration expression:

[source]
----
__config__.app?.getApp('studio')?.getEnableStudioApp()
----

This expression is evaluated in `showIf` conditions on the `studioApp` field panels across all Studio component forms (MetaJsonModel, MetaJsonField, StudioMenu, StudioAction, StudioSelection, StudioChart, StudioDashboard, MetaAction).
