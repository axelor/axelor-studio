The Studio module is a low-code/no-code platform that allows you to customize your Axelor application using a graphical interface, without writing code. It provides tools to build custom data models, design views, create menus, define business logic, and package your customizations into installable applications.

== Prerequisites

[NOTE]
====
The Studio module must be activated before use. Go to *Administration > Apps management*, find the *Studio* application, and click btn:[Install] to enable it.
====

Once installed, Studio features become accessible from the **App** menu in the top navigation bar.

== Architecture Overview

Studio is built on three layers:

* **Visual View Builder**: A React-based drag-and-drop form designer embedded as an HTML view within the Axelor application. It allows you to create and modify views directly in the browser.
* **Studio Components**: Backend entities (models, fields, menus, actions, selections) that define your customizations. These are managed through standard Axelor grid and form views.
* **Generation Engine**: Backend services that translate Studio definitions into runtime metadata (XML views, actions, menus) used by the Axelor framework.

All Studio-created components are stored as metadata in the database. No database schema migration is required for custom models -- they use JSON-based storage via `MetaJsonModel` and `MetaJsonField`.

== Feature Overview

Studio is organized into several functional areas, accessible from the **App** menu:

=== Visual View Builder

The core of Studio is a drag-and-drop form designer that allows you to create and modify views directly in the browser.

* **Custom model mode**: Create entirely new data models with custom forms
* **View extension mode**: Add custom fields and panels to existing application views

See xref:studio-features/view-builder.adoc[Visual View Builder] for the complete guide.

=== Studio Components

Under *App > Studio components*, you can manage the building blocks of your customizations:

* xref:studio-features/custom-models.adoc[**Custom Models**] -- Create new data models (entities) with their own forms and menus, stored as JSON-based definitions
* xref:studio-features/custom-fields.adoc[**Custom Fields**] -- Add fields of various types (text, number, date, relational) to existing models without modifying source code
* xref:studio-features/menus.adoc[**Menus**] -- Create and organize menu entries with icons, permissions, and conditions to navigate to your custom views
* xref:studio-features/actions.adoc[**Actions**] -- Define business logic through five action types: create records, update data, run scripts, open views, or send emails
* xref:studio-features/selections.adoc[**Selections**] -- Manage selection lists (dropdowns) with custom values, colors, and icons

=== Reporting

Under *App > Reporting*, you can build visual reports:

* xref:studio-features/charts.adoc[**Charts**] -- Create charts from your data with 11 chart types (bar, line, pie, donut, radar, gauge, and more)
* xref:studio-features/dashboards.adoc[**Dashboards**] -- Assemble charts, grids, and custom views into dashboard pages

=== Configuration

Under *App > Configuration*:

* xref:studio-features/studio-apps.adoc[**Studio Apps**] -- Package your customizations into applications that can be installed, exported, and imported (requires `enableStudioApp`)
* xref:studio-features/actions.adoc#custom-actions[**Custom Actions**] -- Create low-level XML-based actions with full control over action definitions
* xref:studio-features/app-loaders.adoc[**App Loaders**] -- Import and export Studio Apps as files for deployment across environments (requires `enableStudioApp`)
* xref:studio-features/configuration.adoc[**Configuration**] -- Configure Studio behavior (enable/disable App grouping, web service tracking)

=== Apps Management

Under *Administration > Apps management*:

* xref:studio-features/apps-management.adoc[**Apps Management**] -- Central hub for installing, uninstalling, and configuring all applications (both standard and custom)

== Key Concepts

=== Custom vs. Standard Models

Studio works with two types of data models:

[cols="1,1,1", options="header"]
|===
| Aspect | Custom Models (JSON) | Standard Models (XML)

| Created by
| Studio interface
| Application source code

| Storage
| JSON fields in `MetaJsonModel` / `MetaJsonField` tables
| Database tables defined by XML domain files

| Schema migration
| Not required
| Required (via Gradle build)

| Studio capabilities
| Full control: create, modify, delete
| Extend only: add custom fields, modify views

| Entity
| `MetaJsonModel`
| `MetaModel`
|===

TIP: Custom models are ideal for rapid prototyping and business-specific entities. Use standard models when you need database-level constraints, indexing, or complex relationships.

=== Conditional Expressions

Studio uses conditional expressions to control field visibility and behavior. These expressions allow you to show, hide, or make fields required based on other field values.

See xref:studio-features/conditions.adoc[Conditional Expressions] for syntax and examples.

=== Studio App Packaging

When the Studio App feature is enabled (via xref:studio-features/configuration.adoc[Configuration]), all Studio components (models, fields, menus, actions, charts, dashboards) can be grouped under a **Studio App**. This allows you to:

* Package related customizations together
* Export and import customizations across environments
* Manage the lifecycle (install, uninstall, delete) of your custom applications
* View all related components from a single place

See xref:studio-features/studio-apps.adoc[Studio Apps] and xref:studio-features/app-loaders.adoc[App Loaders] for details.

== Menu Structure

The following table shows the complete menu hierarchy for Studio features:

WARNING: The *Apps*, *App Loaders*, and Studio App-related fields on component forms are only visible when the `enableStudioApp` option is active. See xref:studio-features/configuration.adoc[Configuration] to enable it.
