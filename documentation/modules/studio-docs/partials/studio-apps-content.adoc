== Overview

Studio Apps allow you to package related Studio customizations (models, fields, menus, actions, selections, charts, dashboards) into a single application unit. This provides lifecycle management with install/uninstall capabilities, and export/import for deploying customizations across environments.

Studio Apps are managed from *App > Configuration > Apps*.

[NOTE]
====
The Apps menu entry is only visible when `enableStudioApp` is enabled in the xref:studio-docs:studio-features/configuration.adoc[Studio configuration]. This is enabled by default.
====

== App Views

Studio Apps can be displayed in two views:

=== Cards View

image::studio-docs:studio-features/studio-app-cards.png[Studio Apps cards view,align="center"]

The cards view provides a visual overview of all Studio Apps with:

- App image/logo
- Name and code
- Description excerpt
- Active/inactive status badge
- btn:[Delete] button (only visible when the app is not installed)

The cards view also provides an btn:[Import] button in the toolbar for importing apps from ZIP files.

=== Grid View

The grid view displays apps in a tabular format with columns for name, code, and active status. It also provides btn:[Import] and btn:[Export] toolbar buttons.

== Install and Uninstall

=== Install

The btn:[Install] button appears in the form sidebar when:

- The app record has been saved (has an ID)
- The app is not currently installed (`generatedApp.active` is false)

Installing an app:

. Generates the required `App` record
. Activates all associated menus, views, and actions
. Makes the app's customizations available to users

=== Uninstall

The btn:[Uninstall] button appears when:

- The app record has been saved (has an ID)
- The app is currently installed (`generatedApp.active` is true)

WARNING: Uninstalling an app deactivates all its associated components. Users will no longer have access to the custom models, menus, and actions defined by the app.

== Export and Import

=== Export

The btn:[Export] button is available in the form toolbar. Clicking it opens an export dialog:

image::studio-docs:studio-features/studio-app-export.png[Export dialog,align="center"]

- *Export data* (1): When checked, the export includes not only the app definition (models, fields, menus, etc.) but also the actual data records created through the custom models.

The export generates a ZIP file containing all the app's components.

[TIP]
====
Use the *Export data* option when transferring a fully configured app with sample or reference data to another environment. Leave it unchecked to export only the structure (models, views, actions) without data.
====

=== Import

The btn:[Import] button is available in the grid/cards toolbar. Clicking it opens an import dialog:

- *Data file* (1): Upload the ZIP file to import (MetaFile binary-link widget).

The import process:

. Reads the ZIP file contents
. Creates or updates the Studio App and all its components
. Registers the generated views, menus, and actions

[WARNING]
====
Importing an app with the same code as an existing app will update the existing app's components. Review the import contents carefully before proceeding.
