== Overview

Studio Dashboards allow you to combine multiple charts, data grids, and custom views into a single overview page. Each dashboard is composed of configurable dashlets that can be arranged in a multi-column layout.

Dashboards are managed from *App > Reporting > Dashboards*.

== Creating a Dashboard

Navigate to *App > Reporting > Dashboards* and click btn:[New].

=== Dashboard Fields

[cols="1,1,3", options="header"]
|===
| Field | Required | Description

| *Name* (1)
| Yes
| Unique technical name of the dashboard. Must not contain spaces. The name is validated and normalized automatically.

| *Title* (2)
| Yes
| Display title shown as the dashboard page header.

| *Studio App* (3)
| No
| Associates the dashboard with a xref:studio-docs:studio-features/studio-apps.adoc[Studio App] for packaging. Only visible when `enableStudioApp` is active (see xref:studio-docs:studio-features/configuration.adoc[Configuration]).
|===

== Dashlets

The *Dashlets* panel defines the content blocks displayed on the dashboard. Dashlets are listed in an editable grid with drag-and-drop reordering (canMove).

=== Dashlet Configuration

[cols="1,1,3", options="header"]
|===
| Field | Required | Description

| *Name*
| Yes
| Technical name of the dashlet. Must be unique within the dashboard.

| *View type*
| No
| Type of content displayed. Restricted to three options: *chart*, *grid*, or *custom*.

| *Meta view*
| Conditional
| Reference to an existing view (`MetaView`). Required if no action is set. The view selector is filtered to show only views matching the selected view type.

| *Action*
| Conditional
| Reference to an action (`MetaAction`) that provides the dashlet data. Required if no meta view is set. Filtered to show only `action-view` type actions.

| *Colspan*
| No
| Width of the dashlet in grid columns (out of 12). Default: 6. Maximum: 12.

| *Height*
| No
| Fixed height of the dashlet in pixels. Default: 350 when set to 0.

| *Can search*
| No
| Whether the dashlet includes a search bar. Only shown for *grid*-type dashlets.

| *Pagination limit*
| No
| Number of records shown per page. Only shown for *grid*-type dashlets.

| *Sequence*
| No
| Display order of the dashlet on the dashboard. Dashlets are ordered by ascending sequence.
|===

WARNING: A dashlet must have either a *Meta view* or an *Action* -- not both. The form enforces mutual exclusion: when one field has a value, the other is hidden.

=== Layout Guidelines

Use the *Colspan* property to create multi-column layouts:

[cols="1,2", options="header"]
|===
| Colspan | Layout

| `12`
| Full-width dashlet (one per row)

| `6`
| Half-width dashlet (two per row)

| `4`
| Third-width dashlet (three per row)

| `3`
| Quarter-width dashlet (four per row)
|===

[TIP]
====
Combine charts and data grids on a single dashboard to create comprehensive overview pages. For example, place a sales trend chart (colspan=8) next to a top customers list (colspan=4).

=== Dashlet Types

==== Chart Dashlet

Displays a xref:studio-docs:studio-features/charts.adoc[Studio Chart] or any chart-type MetaView. Use this to embed visual data representations.

==== Grid Dashlet

Displays a list of records using a grid view. When using this type:

* Enable *Can search* to allow users to filter data within the dashlet
* Set *Pagination limit* to control the number of visible rows

==== Custom Dashlet

Displays a custom view (e.g., a form or HTML view). Use this for specialized displays that do not fit the chart or grid pattern.

== View Generation

When a dashboard is saved, Studio automatically generates the following runtime metadata:

* A `MetaView` of type `dashboard` containing the `<dashlet>` XML definitions
* One `MetaAction` of type `action-view` for each dashlet that references a MetaView (dashlets using existing actions reuse them directly)

The generated view and actions are stored in the `metaViewGenerated` and `generatedActions` fields of the dashboard entity.

NOTE: If all dashlets are removed from a dashboard, the generated MetaView is automatically deleted on save.

== Import and Export

Dashboards support import/export as part of Studio App packaging:

* **Export**: Produces XML data with dashboard name, title, model, studioApp reference, and dashlet definitions
* **Import**: A two-step process -- first imports the dashboard data, then triggers a rebuild to regenerate the MetaView and MetaActions

The rebuild is triggered by a secondary import configuration that calls `ImportService.importAppStudioDashboard()`, which saves each imported dashboard to invoke the generation logic.

== Technical Details

Dashboards are stored in the `StudioDashboard` entity (`com.axelor.studio.db`, cacheable).

Key entities:

[cols="1,2", options="header"]
|===
| Entity | Description

| `StudioDashboard`
| Dashboard definition with title, name, dashlet list

| `StudioDashlet`
| Individual dashlet definition with view type, layout, and data source
|===

Key services:

* `StudioDashboardServiceImpl.build()` -- Iterates dashlets, generates action-views using the `dashboardActionView.tmpl` template, creates the dashboard MetaView
* `StudioDashboardRepo.save()` -- Triggers `build()` on every save to regenerate the view
* `StudioDashboardRepo.remove()` -- Cleans up the generated MetaView before removal

The `StudioDashlet` entity has a unique constraint on `(name, studioDashboard)`, ensuring no duplicate dashlet names within a dashboard.
