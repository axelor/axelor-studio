== Overview

The Apps Management screen is the central hub for managing all applications in your Axelor instance -- both standard applications (delivered with the platform) and custom applications (created through xref:studio-docs:studio-features/studio-apps.adoc[Studio Apps]). It provides install, uninstall, configure, and data import capabilities.

Apps Management is accessed from *Administration > Apps management*.

[NOTE]
====
Custom Studio Apps appear in this list only when their *Show in app view* (`isInAppView`) property is enabled. See xref:studio-docs:studio-features/studio-apps.adoc[Studio Apps] for details.

== App Views

=== Cards View

The default view displays apps as cards with visual type badges:

[cols="1,2", options="header"]
|===
| Badge Color | App Type

| Blue
| Standard

| Orange
| Addons

| Brown
| Enterprise

| Red
| Pro

| Purple
| Custom

| Gray
| Others
|===

Each card shows the app image, name, code, description, and current status (installed or not).

Available buttons on each card:

* btn:[Install] -- Installs the app (shown when not active)
* btn:[Configure] -- Opens the app-specific configuration form (shown when active)
* btn:[Export] -- Exports the app (shown when active, for Studio Apps only)
* btn:[Uninstall] -- Uninstalls the app (shown when active)
* btn:[Delete] -- Deletes the app (shown when not active, for Studio Apps only)

The cards toolbar provides:

* btn:[Bulk install] -- Install multiple apps at once
* btn:[Import roles] -- Import roles for all installed apps

=== Grid View

The grid view displays apps in a tabular format with columns: name, active status, demo data loaded, type, and version.

NOTE: The grid and form are read-only for app creation and deletion (`canDelete=false`, `canNew=false`). App records are managed through install/uninstall operations.

=== Form View

image::studio-docs:studio/apps-management-form.png[App Management form view]

The form view provides:

* App image, name, and language selector
* Demo data loaded status
* Type and version badges
* Description (large text)
* Dependencies panel (`dependsOnSet`) showing required apps

== Install and Uninstall

=== Installing an App

Click btn:[Install] on the app card or in the form sidebar. A confirmation dialog appears before proceeding.

The installation process:

. Resolves dependencies (installs required apps first)
. Loads initial data for the app
. Registers menus, views, and actions
. Marks the app as active

=== Uninstalling an App

Click btn:[Uninstall] on the app card or in the form sidebar. A confirmation dialog appears before proceeding.

WARNING: Uninstalling an app deactivates its menus, views, and actions. Data created through the app remains in the database but becomes inaccessible through the UI.

== Configure

The btn:[Configure] button opens the app-specific configuration form. Each app type has its own configuration entity and form:

* **Studio** -> `AppStudio` configuration (see xref:studio-docs:studio-features/configuration.adoc[Configuration])
* **BPM** -> `AppBpm` configuration
* Other apps may have their own configuration forms

The Configure button is only available when the app is installed (active).

== Bulk Install

The btn:[Bulk install] button in the cards toolbar opens a dialog for installing multiple apps at once:

image::studio-docs:studio/apps-management-bulk-install.png[Bulk install dialog]

[cols="1,3", options="header"]
|===
| Field | Description

| *Apps*
| Select multiple apps to install (M2M selector)

| *Language*
| Language for the installed apps (selection: `select.language`)

| *Import demo data*
| When checked, demo data is imported during installation
|===

Click btn:[Install] in the dialog to start the bulk installation process.

== Demo Data Import

The btn:[Import demo data] button imports sample/reference data for the app. This is useful for testing and evaluation purposes.

WARNING: Demo data import is only available in non-production environments (`application.mode != 'prod'`). This button is hidden in production mode.

== Roles Import

Two options for importing application roles:

* btn:[Import roles] (form sidebar) -- Imports roles for the current app
* btn:[Import roles] (cards toolbar) -- Imports roles for all installed apps

Role import loads predefined role and permission configurations associated with the app.

== Technical Details

Apps are stored in the `App` entity (`com.axelor.studio.db`):

[cols="1,1,2", options="header"]

The domain filter for the Apps Management view:

[source]
----
self.isCustom = null OR self.isCustom = false OR (self.isCustom = true AND self.isInAppView = true)
----

This ensures only standard apps and custom apps with `isInAppView=true` are displayed.

Key backend services:

* `AppController.installApp()` -- Installs the app with dependency resolution
* `AppController.uninstallApp()` -- Uninstalls the app
* `AppController.configure()` -- Opens the app-specific configuration form
* `AppController.importDataDemo()` -- Imports demo data (non-prod only)
* `AppController.bulkInstall()` -- Installs multiple apps
* `AppController.importRoles()` / `importAllRoles()` -- Imports role configurations
