== Overview

App Loaders provide import and export capabilities for xref:studio-docs:studio-features/studio-apps.adoc[Studio Apps]. They allow you to transfer complete app packages -- including their component definitions and optionally their data -- between different Axelor environments (e.g., from development to production).

App Loaders are managed from *App > Configuration > App Loaders*.

[NOTE]
====
The App Loaders menu entry is only visible when `enableStudioApp` is enabled in the xref:studio-docs:studio-features/configuration.adoc[Studio configuration].

The grid view opens with a detail view layout (`details-view=true`), showing both the list and the form side by side.

== App Loader Form

Each App Loader record has two tabs: Import and Export.

. Upload the ZIP file in the *Import file* field
. Click btn:[Import]
. Review the *Imported apps* list and check the *Import log* for any issues

=== Export Tab

The export tab allows you to package selected Studio Apps into a downloadable file.

[cols="1,1,3", options="header"]
|===
| Field | Type | Description

| *Export apps*
| M2M: StudioApp (TagSelect)
| Select the Studio Apps to include in the export.

| *Export file*
| File (BinaryLink, readonly)
| After export, the generated ZIP file is attached here.

| DateTime (readonly)
| Timestamp of the last export operation.

| *Export data*
| O2M: AppDataLoader
| Configure data export rules for each model. See <<data-loaders>> below.
|===

. Select the Studio Apps to export in the *Export apps* field
. Optionally configure data export rules (see below)

. Download the generated file from the *Export file* field

[[data-loaders]]
== Data Export Configuration (AppDataLoader)

The *Export data* panel allows you to define which model data should be included in the export. Each `AppDataLoader` entry specifies a model and the fields and search criteria for its data.

image::studio-docs:studio/app-loader-data-config.png[AppDataLoader configuration]

[cols="1,1,3", options="header"]
|===
| Field | Type | Description

| *Is JSON*
| Boolean
| Toggle between custom (JSON) models and standard models.

| *Model* (standard)
| M2O: MetaModel
| The standard model whose data should be exported. Shown when *Is JSON* is unchecked.

| *Model* (JSON)
| M2O: MetaJsonModel
| The JSON model whose data should be exported. Shown when *Is JSON* is checked.

| *Fields* (standard)
| M2M: MetaField
| The fields to include in the export for standard models.

| *Fields* (JSON)
| M2M: MetaJsonField
| The fields to include in the export for JSON models.

| *Search fields* (standard)
| M2M: MetaField
| Fields used to identify existing records during import (match criteria).

| *Search fields* (JSON)
| M2M: MetaJsonField
| Fields used to identify existing records during import (match criteria) for JSON models.

| *Filter query*
| Large String
| A JPQL-like filter expression to restrict which records are exported.

| *Sequence*
| Integer
| Order in which data loaders are processed during export.
|===

[TIP]
====
Use *Search fields* to define how the import process identifies whether a record already exists. For example, if you set `code` as a search field, the import will match records by their `code` value and update them instead of creating duplicates.
====

=== Example: Exporting Product Data

To include product data in your app export:

. Add a new entry in the *Export data* panel
. Set *Is JSON* to unchecked (standard model)
. Select the `Product` model
. Select the fields to export: `code`, `name`, `salePrice`, `purchasePrice`
. Set *Search fields* to `code` (used for matching during import)
. Optionally add a filter: `self.productTypeSelect = 'storable'` to export only storable products
. Set *Sequence* to control processing order
