== Overview

Studio Charts allow you to create visual data representations from your application models. Charts are configurable through a form-based interface -- no coding required. Studio supports 11 chart types, from standard bar and line charts to specialized gauges and funnels.

Charts are managed from *App > Reporting > Charts*.

== Creating a Chart

Navigate to *App > Reporting > Charts* and click btn:[New].

=== Basic Information

[cols="1,1,3", options="header"]
|===
| Field | Required | Description

| *Name* (1)
| Yes
| Unique technical name of the chart. Must not contain spaces. The name is validated and normalized automatically.

| *Title* (2)
| Yes
| Display title shown above the chart.

| *Chart type* (3)
| Yes
| The visualization type. Default: `bar`. See <<chart-types>> below.

| *Is JSON* (4)
| No
| Toggle between custom (JSON) models and standard models.

| *Model* (5)
| No
| The data model to query for chart data. When using JSON models, select from `MetaJsonModel`; otherwise from `MetaModel`.

| *Studio App* (6)
| No
| Associates the chart with a xref:studio-docs:studio-features/studio-apps.adoc[Studio App] for packaging. Only visible when `enableStudioApp` is active (see xref:studio-docs:studio-features/configuration.adoc[Configuration]).
|===

NOTE: The aggregate, group, display, and filter panels are only visible after a model has been selected.

== Chart Types

Studio supports 11 chart types, each suited for different data visualization needs:

[cols="1,3", options="header"]
|===
| Type | Description

| **Bar**
| Vertical bar chart. Best for comparing quantities across categories.

| **Horizontal Bar** (hbar)
| Horizontal bar chart. Useful when category labels are long.

| **Line**
| Line chart. Ideal for showing trends over time.

| **Area**
| Area chart (filled line). Emphasizes volume under the trend line.

| **Pie**
| Pie chart. Shows proportional distribution of a whole.

| **Donut**
| Donut chart (ring). Similar to pie but with a hollow center.

| **Radar**
| Radar/spider chart. Compares multiple variables on radial axes.

| **Scatter**
| Scatter plot. Shows correlation between two numeric variables.

| **Gauge**
| Gauge chart. Displays a single value within a range.

| **Funnel**
| Funnel chart. Shows progressive reduction through stages.

| **Text**
| Text display. Shows a computed value as formatted text.
|===

== Data Configuration

Each chart requires three configuration dimensions: what to measure (aggregate), how to categorize (group), and what to display (display field).

=== Aggregate (Measure)

The aggregate defines the value computed and displayed on the chart axis.

[cols="1,3", options="header"]
|===
| Field | Description

| *Is JSON*
| Toggle to select a MetaJsonField instead of a MetaField.

| *Aggregate on*
| The field to aggregate. Select a `MetaField` (standard models) or `MetaJsonField` (JSON models).

| *Target*
| When the aggregate field is a relational field, specify the target field to aggregate on. Auto-detected based on the selected field.

| *Date type*
| When aggregating a date field, select the granularity: *day*, *month*, or *year*. Only shown for date-type fields.
|===

=== Group By (Dimension)

The group dimension defines how data is categorized along the chart axis.

[cols="1,3", options="header"]
|===
| Field | Description

| *Is JSON*
| Toggle to select a MetaJsonField instead of a MetaField.

| *Group on*
| The field to group by. Select a `MetaField` or `MetaJsonField`.

| *Target*
| Target field for relational group fields. Auto-detected.

| *Date type*
| Grouping granularity for date fields: *day*, *month*, or *year*. Only shown for date-type fields.
|===

=== Display Field

The display field provides an alternative label for chart data points.

[cols="1,3", options="header"]
|===
| Field | Description

| *Is JSON*
| Toggle to select a MetaJsonField instead of a MetaField.

| *Display field*
| An optional field used for display labels instead of the group field's raw value.

| *Display type*
| How the value is formatted: *Value* (0) shows the raw number, *Percentage* (1) shows the value as a percentage of the total.
|===

== Filters

The *Filters* panel allows you to restrict the data included in the chart. Filters are stored as `Filter` entities linked to the chart.

image::studio-docs:studio/chart-filters.png[Chart filters panel]

[cols="1,3", options="header"]
|===
| Field | Description

| *Is JSON*
| Toggle between standard and JSON model fields.

| *Target field*
| The field to filter on (MetaField or MetaJsonField).

| *Target type*
| The data type of the target field (auto-detected).

| *Operator*
| Comparison operator. See <<filter-operators>> below.

| *Value*
| The comparison value.

| *Is parameter*
| When checked, the filter appears as a user-configurable parameter on the chart view, allowing end users to adjust the filter at runtime.

| *Logic operator*
| Combine multiple filters with *AND* (0, default) or *OR* (1).
|===

[[filter-operators]]
=== Available Filter Operators

Studio provides 16 filter operators:

[cols="1,2", options="header"]
|===
| Operator | Description

| `=` | Equals
| `!=` | Not equals
| `>` | Greater than
| `>=` | Greater than or equal
| `<` | Less than
| `\<=` | Less than or equal
| `in` | Value is in a list
| `notIn` | Value is not in a list
| `like` | Pattern matching (SQL LIKE)
| `notLike` | Negative pattern matching
| `isNull` | Field is null
| `notNull` | Field is not null
| `isTrue` | Boolean is true
| `isFalse` | Boolean is false
| `include` | Collection includes value
| `notInclude` | Collection does not include value
|===

=== Filter Value Variables

Use these built-in variables in filter values:

* `$date` -- Today's date
* `$time` -- Current time

[TIP]
====
Use the *Is parameter* option to create interactive charts where users can adjust filter criteria at runtime. For example, add a date range parameter so users can view data for different periods.
====

== Example: Monthly Sales Chart

To create a bar chart showing confirmed order totals by month:

. Create a chart with name `custom.monthly.sales` and title "Monthly Sales"
. Set chart type to *Bar*
. Set model to `SaleOrder`
. Set *Aggregate on* to `exTaxTotal`
. Set *Group on* to `orderDate`
. Set *Group date type* to `month`
. Add a filter: `statusSelect` equals `3` (confirmed orders)

This produces a bar chart displaying the sum of `exTaxTotal` for each month, filtering only confirmed orders.

== Technical Details

Charts are stored in the `StudioChart` entity (`com.axelor.studio.db`, cacheable). When a chart is saved, a `MetaView` of type `chart` is automatically generated and registered in the application.

Key backend services:

* `StudioChartServiceImpl` -- Resolves default target fields and target types for relational and date fields
* `StudioChartController.viewRelatedRecord()` -- Handles click events on chart data points to navigate to the related records
