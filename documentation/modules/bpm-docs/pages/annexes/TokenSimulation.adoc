== Token simulation

In the **Design** mode of the Modeler, token simulation provides a way to explore BPMN execution semantics by allowing you to play, pause, and step through processes, mimicking the behavior of a BPMN 2.0 compliant engine.


TIP: Token simulation serves as an educational tool for BPMN, rather than a complete BPMN engine.

=== Turn on/off

First, open your BPMN diagram in Modeler and switch to **Design** mode.

To turn the feature on/off, use the **Token Simulation** toggle (or the keyboard shortcut `T` inside the canvas). The modeling features will not work while you are in token simulation mode.

=== Start simulation

The simulation can be started by triggering an event using the corresponding button:

=== Token simulation palette

The palette on the left side provides the following controls:

1. ** Play/pause simulation**
2. ** Reset simulation**
3. ** Show simulation log**

=== Animation speed palette



The speed of the simulation can be changed using the controls in the bottom palette:
