== Overview

The BPM module enables you to design, deploy, and manage business processes based on the *BPMN 2.0* standard. It provides a fully integrated modeling environment within the Axelor application, allowing both technical and functional users to automate workflows.

A process is only effective once it has been *deployed*. There are several ways to launch an instance from a deployed process.

== Key Features

* **xref:introduction/index.adoc[BPM Studio]**: A visual BPMN modeler for designing process diagrams with a drag-and-drop palette, properties panel, and toolbar.
* **xref:BPMN/tasks/user_task.adoc[BPMN Elements]**: Full support for BPMN 2.0 elements including events, tasks, gateways, and subprocesses.
* **xref:DMN/creation_modele_dmn.adoc[DMN Editor]**: Create and manage Decision Model and Notation (DMN) decision tables for business rules.
* **xref:general-documentation/builders/builders_introduction.adoc[Builders]**: Graphical tools (Expression Builder, Query Builder, Mapper, Web Service Script) for generating Groovy scripts without manual coding.
* **xref:general-documentation/utilities/merge_split.adoc[Merge & Split]**: Combine or divide BPMN models across participants.
* **xref:general-documentation/process-instance/display-logs.adoc[Process Instance Monitoring]**: Track running instances, visualize variables, detect errors, and modify instances at runtime.
* **xref:annexes/TokenSimulation.adoc[Token Simulation]**: Simulate process execution in design mode for educational and testing purposes.

== Menu Structure

The BPM features are accessible from the *Application Builder* menu:
