You thus access the BPM studio. A tab has opened and you should have a similar visual.

== BPM Modeler

The BPM modeler is the main area where you will design your process. It is composed of several elements that we will detail below.

=== The Horizontal Toolbar

At the top left, a toolbar similar to this one is visible:

image::introduction/bpm_modeler_toolbar.png[toolbar,align="left"]

This toolbar allows you to perform various actions on the BPM model you are working on.

1. **New Model Button** : Create a new BPM model.
2. **Save Button** : Save the BPM model, this action save the current diagram in the database.
3. **Delete Button** : Delete the BPM model, this action is irreversible.
4. **Refresh Button** : Reload the process model canvas.
5. **Deploy Button** : Deploy the BPM model, this action makes the executable process effective.
6. **Properties Panel Button** : Show or hide the properties panel of the BPM model.
7. **Import Button** : Load a BPM model from a bpmn file.
8. **Export Button** : Download the BPM model in a bpmn file.
9. **Save as Image Button** : Download the BPM model as an image in .svg format.
10. **Open split tool** : Open the split tool to split the bpm model in case of multiple participant in a new tab.
11. **Open the merge tool** : Open the merge tool to merge multiple bpm model in one in a new tab.

In the middle of this toolbar, there is a dropdown field that allows you to choose the model you want to work on.

=== BPM Model properties

On the right side of the screen, you will find the properties panel of the BPM model, it can be divided in 3 parts:

==== 1. General properties

image::introduction/bpm_model_properties_general.png[General properties,align="left"]

1. **Status** : The status of the process, it can be New, On going or Terminated.
2. **Code** : The code of the process, it must be unique and will be automatically capitalized.
3. **Name** : The name of the process, it is free and without constraint.
4. **Application attached** : If needed the BPM model can be attached to an application.
5. **Version tag** : The tag of the current version of the BPM model.
image:introduction/bpm_model_properties_version_dashlet.png[version tag,align="left"]
In case of multiple versions of the BPM model, you can see the previous versions listed in the dashlet, the left icon open the BPM model.
6. **New version on deploy** : If checked, a new version of the BPM model will be created for every deployment.
7. **Color of the workflow status** : The color of the workflow status displayed in form view.


TIP: Clicking on the properties label will collapse or expand the properties panel.


==== 2. Buttons

Once the model is deployed you can see the following buttons:

1. **Terminate** : Terminate the process, all running instances will be terminated as well.
2. **BPM State** : Display the BPM state of the process. By clicking on it, a new tab will open with the BPM state of the process where the total instances token are aggregated by nodes
image:introduction/bpm_model_properties_display_sate.png[display state,align="left"]
In this example, we have a total of 5 instances, all of them have reached at least the user task and 3 of them have reached the end event.
3. **New version** : Generate a new version of the BPM model.
4. **Dashboard** : Display the dashboard of the BPM model. Clicking on it will open a popup to choose the concerned process since a model can contain multiple processes.

== BPM Studio

Direcly in the modeler you have serveral tools to help you design your process.

=== The Palette

The palette is located on the left side of the BPM modeler, it contains all the elements you can use to design your process.

1. **Hand** : Move the canvas.

2. **Lasso** : Select multiple elements.

3. **Spacer tool**: Creates space when moved to the right or downward. If moved to the left or upward, it reduces space.

4. **Link tool** : Create a link between two elements.

1. **Events** : Start, intermediate and end events.

2. **Gateway** : Exclusive, inclusive, parallel and event based gateways, by default exclusive gateway is selected.

3. **Activity** : User task, service task, script task, call activity, sub process etc, by default blank task is selected.

4. **Sub process** : Ad hoc, transaction, event sub process, by default ad embeded sub process is selected.

5. **Data** : Data object, data input, data output, by default data object is selected.

6. **Data store** : Database artefacts (non configuration only for design purpose).

7. **Participants** : Insert a new pool in the bpm model.

8. **Artifacts** : Group insertion in the bpm model.

=== The Canvas

The canvas is the main area where you will design your process. It is composed of several elements, and we will there focus on the interaction with them.

==== Node properties

When you click on a node, the properties panel will display the properties of the node.

image::introduction/bpm_modeler_node_actions.png[Node actions,align="left"]

. **Quick insertions** : Insert a new node in the bpm model or an annotation.
. **Configuration** : Configure the node properties, link it to a another node using a flow element or delete it.
image:introduction/bpm_modeler_node_action_properties.png[Node properties,align="left"]
By clicking on the wrench icon, you can configure the node properties, it will open the popup where you can:
.. Apply multi-instance or loop properties.
.. Search within the list.
.. Available properties for the node, the properties are filtered by the type of the node(pool, activity, gateways, etc).
