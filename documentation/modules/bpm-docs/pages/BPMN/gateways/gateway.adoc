== Introduction BPMN [[BPMN]]

Gateways are used to control how the process flows through sequence flows as they converge and diverge within a process. If the flow does not need to be controlled, then a gateway is not needed. The gateway controls the flow of both diverging and converging flows.

== Types of Gateways

=== Exclusive Gateway

The exclusive gateway is represented in the BPMN standard by this diamond shape containing an "X" marker.

It is used to create alternative paths within a process flow. Only one of the paths can be taken, based on a condition. It's like a decision point in the process.

==== Configuration

image::bpmn/gateways/exclusive-gateway-configuration.png[Exclusive gateway configuration, align="center"]

- *Id* (1): Unique ID auto-generated by the system when the node is inserted, it can be manually modified by direct input or by clicking on the cross.

WARNING: It is strongly discouraged to change the ID of a process element after the first deployment to avoid generating migration errors.

- *Name* (2): Name of the gateway, it can be modified at any time.

- **Color** (3): Allows defining the color of the gateway, it is used to differentiate gateways on the diagram.

==== Sequence Flow Configuration

To determine which path should be followed, you need to configure the sequence flows (arrows) coming out of the exclusive gateway:

image::bpmn/gateways/exclusive-gateway-sequence-flow.png[Exclusive gateway sequence flow, align="center"]

- *Condition* (1): A script condition that determines whether this path should be taken. It must return true or false.

- *Default Flow* (2): If checked, this path will be taken if no other path's condition evaluates to true.

=== Parallel Gateway

The parallel gateway is represented in the BPMN standard by this diamond shape containing a "+" marker.

It is used to create parallel paths within a process flow without checking any conditions. All outgoing paths are taken simultaneously.

==== Configuration

The configuration for a parallel gateway is similar to the exclusive gateway, but without conditions on the sequence flows:

image::bpmn/gateways/parallel-gateway-configuration.png[Parallel gateway configuration, align="center"]

- *Id* (1): Unique ID auto-generated by the system when the node is inserted, it can be manually modified by direct input or by clicking on the cross.

- *Name* (2): Name of the gateway, it can be modified at any time.

- **Color** (3): Allows defining the color of the gateway, it is used to differentiate gateways on the diagram.

=== Inclusive Gateway

The inclusive gateway is represented in the BPMN standard by this diamond shape containing an "O" marker.

image::bpmn/gateways/inclusive-gateway-icon.png[Inclusive gateway in bpmn, align="center"]

It is used to create alternative paths within a process flow, but unlike the exclusive gateway, one or more paths can be taken based on conditions.

==== Configuration

The configuration for an inclusive gateway is similar to the exclusive gateway:

image::bpmn/gateways/inclusive-gateway-configuration.png[Inclusive gateway configuration, align="center"]

- *Id* (1): Unique ID auto-generated by the system when the node is inserted, it can be manually modified by direct input or by clicking on the cross.

- *Name* (2): Name of the gateway, it can be modified at any time.

- **Color** (3): Allows defining the color of the gateway, it is used to differentiate gateways on the diagram.

==== Sequence Flow Configuration

To determine which paths should be followed, you need to configure the sequence flows (arrows) coming out of the inclusive gateway:

image::bpmn/gateways/inclusive-gateway-sequence-flow.png[Inclusive gateway sequence flow, align="center"]

- *Condition* (1): A script condition that determines whether this path should be taken. It must return true or false.

- *Default Flow* (2): If checked, this path will be taken if no other path's condition evaluates to true.

=== Event-Based Gateway

The event-based gateway is represented in the BPMN standard by this diamond shape containing a double circle with a pentagon inside.

image::bpmn/gateways/event-based-gateway-icon.png[Event-based gateway in bpmn, align="center"]

It is used to make a decision based on events rather than conditions. The gateway waits for one of the events to occur and then takes the path associated with that event.

==== Configuration

The configuration for an event-based gateway is similar to other gateways:

image::bpmn/gateways/event-based-gateway-configuration.png[Event-based gateway configuration, align="center"]

- *Id* (1): Unique ID auto-generated by the system when the node is inserted, it can be manually modified by direct input or by clicking on the cross.

- *Name* (2): Name of the gateway, it can be modified at any time.

- **Color** (3): Allows defining the color of the gateway, it is used to differentiate gateways on the diagram.

=== Complex Gateway

The complex gateway is represented in the BPMN standard by this diamond shape containing an asterisk (*) marker.

image::bpmn/gateways/complex-gateway-icon.png[Complex gateway in bpmn, align="center"]

It is used to model complex synchronization behavior that cannot be captured using other gateway types.

==== Configuration

The configuration for a complex gateway is similar to other gateways, but with additional options:

image::bpmn/gateways/complex-gateway-configuration.png[Complex gateway configuration, align="center"]

- *Id* (1): Unique ID auto-generated by the system when the node is inserted, it can be manually modified by direct input or by clicking on the cross.

- *Name* (2): Name of the gateway, it can be modified at any time.

- **Color** (3): Allows defining the color of the gateway, it is used to differentiate gateways on the diagram.

- *Activation Condition* (4): A script condition that determines when the gateway should activate. It must return true or false.

== Translations [[Translations]]

It is possible in BPM to indicate translations directly in the properties for the name of the nodes:

image::bpmn/gateways/gateway-translations.png[Translations,align="center"]

- *Translations* (1): Allows adding translations for the name of the node. Translations are added by clicking on the *+* button.
- *List of translations* (2): List of translations added for the node. They can be deleted by clicking on the cross on the right.
- *Language* (3): Language of the translation.

== Listeners [[Listeners]]

It is possible in a BPM model, regardless of the configurable element, to define listeners via the appropriate tab.

image::bpmn/gateways/gateway-listener.png[Listeners,align="center"]

=== Execution Listener

An execution listener is created by clicking the plus *+* button in the list of concerned listeners in the tab.

It applies its Groovy script at the activation or the completion (depending on the user's choice) of the gateway. The script can be written with or without the script xref:general-documentation/builders/builders_introduction.adoc#mapper-builder-usage[builder].

== Comments [[Comments]]

You can add comments to the gateway to explain its purpose or to provide additional information.
