== Introduction to BPMN Error Events

In the Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) standard, an error event represents a specific error condition that occurs during the execution of a process. Error events are used to handle exceptional situations and provide a mechanism for error handling and recovery within a business process.

== Types of Error Events

Error events can be used in different contexts within a BPMN process:

- *Error Start Event:* Initiates a process instance when a specific error is received. This can only be used to start an event subprocess, not a top-level process.
- *Error Boundary Event:* Attached to an activity, it interrupts the activity when a specific error occurs and redirects the flow to an error handling path.
- *Error End Event:* Ends the current process path and throws a specific error that can be caught by an error boundary event or an error start event in an event subprocess.

== Symbolization in BPMN

Error events are symbolized by the following pictograms:

- image:bpmn/events/error-events/error-boundary-event.png[Error boundary event]
- image:bpmn/events/error-events/error-end-event.png[Error end event]

== Configuration for Error Events

To configure an error event, you need to specify the error in the general tab of the properties panel:

=== Error Start Event Configuration

For an error start event (which can only be used in an event subprocess):

- *If no error is specified:* The event subprocess will be triggered for any error thrown in the parent process.
- *Error Code:* Contains the error code that will be used to match with thrown errors.
- *Error Message:* Contains the error message that will be displayed with the error.

=== Error Boundary Event Configuration

For an error boundary event:

- *If no error is specified:* The event will be triggered for any error thrown by the activity it is attached to, without considering a specific error or error code.
- *If an error is specified:* The event will only be triggered for errors that match the specified error code.
- *Error Code Variable:* If specified, the error code of the caught error will be stored in this variable.
- *Error Message Variable:* If specified, the error message of the caught error will be stored in this variable.

=== Error End Event Configuration

For an error end event:

- *Error Code:* Required. Contains the error code that will be thrown.
- *Error Message:* Contains the error message that will be thrown with the error.

=== Creating an Error

To create an error:

1. Click on the *+* icon to automatically generate an error.
2. An Error Name will be automatically generated, but it is recommended to change it to make it more understandable.
3. You can search for existing errors in the BPM model or from other BPM models.

== Use Cases for Error Events

Error events are commonly used for:

1. *Exception Handling:* Handling exceptional situations that occur during process execution.
2. *Error Recovery:* Providing a mechanism for recovering from errors and continuing the process.
3. *Process Termination:* Terminating a process or subprocess when an unrecoverable error occurs.
4. *Error Notification:* Notifying relevant stakeholders about errors that occur during process execution.

== Listeners

It is possible in a BPM model, regardless of the configurable element, to define listeners via the appropriate tab.

=== Execution Listener

An execution listener is created by clicking the plus *+* button in the list of concerned listeners in the tab.

It applies its Groovy script at the activation or the completion (depending on the user's choice) of the event. The script can be written with or without the script xref:general-documentation/builders/builders_introduction.adoc#mapper-builder-usage[builder].

== Comments

You can add comments to the error event to explain its purpose or to provide additional information.
