== Introduction to BPMN Message Events

In the Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) standard, a message represents a form of communication between two participants in a process. This communication is modeled as a message event within BPMN diagrams, which can either be a catching or throwing (sending) event. Messages are fundamental in depicting the flow of information across different parts of a process or between different processes.

== Differences Between Catching and Sending Messages

- *Catching Message Event:* Represents a point in the process where it waits to receive a message. Symbolized by a single thin outline.
- *Sending Message Event:* Indicates where a message is sent from the process to an external participant. Depicted with a double outline.

== Modeling Messages in BPMN

BPMN models messages with specific icons to differentiate between catching and sending events, ensuring clear communication and coordination between different parts of a process or across multiple processes.

== Restrictions Provided by the BPMN Standard

1. *Correlation:* Ensures messages are delivered to and received by the correct process instances.
2. *Instantiation:* A start message event can initiate a new process instance with a defined message.
3. *Unidirectional:* Messages are unidirectional, meaning they can only be sent from one process instance and received by another.

== Configurations for Message Events

We can distinguish between the following message events:

1. *Catch Message Start Event*: A start event can only receive a message

2. *Intermediate Message Event*: An intermediate event can send or receive a message

3. *End Message Event*: An end event can only send a message

=== Creating a message

To create a message, you must first define the message in the general tab of the properties panel:

image::bpmn/events/message-events/message-generation-step-1.png[message creation]

(1) - Automatically generate a message by clicking on the *+* icon.

(2) - Allow you to search model from other BPM models.

(3) - Display the newly created message or search for existing messages in the BPM model.

For an intermediate event (image:message-icon-3.png[message icon], image:message-icon-4.png[message icon]), it is necessary to specify the name of the process in which it is **received** by adding the suffix **$+{Process_X}+** to the message name.

Here the message signal is received in the Pizza_main process.

Symbolized by image:message-icon-3.png[message icon], image:message-icon-5.png[message icon] It triggers a message send.

It is necessary to set up the delivered or pending message in the general tab of the properties panel.
