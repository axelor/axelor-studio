== Introduction

Each deployed BPM model has its own dedicated dashboard that displays process execution statistics through three charts. These charts query the Camunda process engine's history tables to provide real-time metrics on task statuses and time spent in each activity.

== Access

The model dashboard is accessed from the BPM model form:

. Open a deployed BPM model from *Application Builder > BPM components > BPM models*
. Click the btn:[Dashboard] button in the model form

If the model contains **multiple processes**, a selection wizard appears allowing you to choose which process to display. If the model has a single process, the dashboard opens directly.

== Dashboard Charts

The model dashboard (`dasbhoard-wkf-model`) displays three charts:

=== Status per Month

Displays the distribution of activity statuses aggregated by month.

- *Chart type*: Bar
- *Data source*: `chart.wkf.model.status.per.month`
- *Default date range*: Last 6 months
- *Search fields*: From date, To date

This chart shows how many activities were started, completed, or are still pending for each month, helping identify trends and seasonal patterns in process execution.

=== Status per Day

Displays the distribution of activity statuses aggregated by day, providing a more granular view than the monthly chart.

- *Chart type*: Bar
- *Data source*: `chart.wkf.model.status.per.day`
- *Default date range*: Last month
- *Search fields*: From date, To date

=== Time Spent per Status (Hours)

Displays the total time spent in each activity status, measured in hours. This chart is essential for identifying which activities are bottlenecks.

- *Chart type*: Bar
- *Data source*: `chart.wkf.model.time.spent.per.status`
- *Default date range*: Last year
- *Search fields*: From date, To date

[TIP]
====
Use the "Time spent per status" chart to identify activities where users spend disproportionate time. High time values may indicate unclear instructions, complex approval processes, or design issues that can be optimized.

== Chart Click-Through

All three charts support click-through interaction. Clicking on a chart element opens a model selector wizard (`action-chart-wkf-view-open-wizard`) that allows you to navigate to the underlying process data.

== Technical Details

=== Data Source

All charts query the Camunda process engine's history table `act_hi_actinst` (historical activity instances), joined with the `studio_wkf_instance` table. The queries filter activities by the following types:

* `userTask` -- User-assigned tasks
* Catch events -- Intermediate catch events
* Timer events -- Timer-based events

NOTE: The charts require the Camunda engine to be running and historical data to be present. If the model has just been deployed with no instances, the charts will be empty.

=== Dashboard Definition

The dashboard is defined as `dasbhoard-wkf-model` with three dashlet panels, each with a fixed height of 350 pixels.

=== Backend Services

* `WkfDashboardController` -- Handles chart data requests and click-through navigation to underlying records
