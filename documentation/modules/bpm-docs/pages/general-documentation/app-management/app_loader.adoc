== Exported Components [[Components]]

The export process includes the following component types:

=== Standard Components (14 types)

studio-app, json-model, json-field, studio-menu, studio-action, studio-dashboard, studio-dashlet, studio-chart, studio-selection, ws-connector, ws-request, ws-authenticator, meta-view, ws-request-list

=== BPM Components (3 additional types)

When BPM components are present, the export also includes:

* *wkf-model*: BPM process models (BPMN XML)
* *wkf-dmn-model*: DMN decision models (DMN XML)
* *baml-model*: BAML models (BAML XML + generated scripts)

These are handled transparently by specialized BPM export/import service extensions.

NOTE: After importing BPM or DMN models via the App Loader, you must deploy each model individually for the processes/decisions to become executable.
