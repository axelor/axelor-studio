== App Entity Auto-Generation [[Auto-Generation]]

When a Studio App is saved, the system automatically generates a corresponding `App` entity (stored in the `generatedApp` field). This generation is triggered by the repository save hook.

The generated App has the following characteristics:

* `isCustom = true`
* `typeSelect = "custom"`
* Image, description, dependencies, sequence, modules, and `isInAppView` are copied from the Studio App

This means every Studio App has a dual existence: the design-time `StudioApp` record and the runtime `App` record. The `App` record is what the xref:general-documentation/app-management/app_management_overview.adoc[Apps Management] interface uses.
