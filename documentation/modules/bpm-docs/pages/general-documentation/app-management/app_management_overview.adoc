== App Initialization at Startup [[Startup]]

When the Axelor server starts, the app system performs two initialization phases:

. *App discovery*: Scans all application modules, reads YAML definition files from each module's `apps/` directory, and creates or updates `App` records. Dependencies between apps are established based on the YAML definitions.

. *Auto-install*: If configured in the application settings, specific apps are automatically installed at startup. The configuration supports:
** `"all"`: Install all available (inactive) apps
** Comma-separated codes (e.g., `"studio,bpm"`): Install only the specified apps

Both phases happen before the application becomes available to users.
