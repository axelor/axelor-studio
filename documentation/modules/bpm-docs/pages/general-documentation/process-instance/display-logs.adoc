== Webapp Configuration

In the `axelor-config.properties` file, you need to set this configuration before deployment:
----
# Enable BPMN logging
studio.bpm.logging = true
----

== Usage in the Application

No configuration is necessary in the application, logs are displayed at the instance level:

[NOTE]
====
1. **Clear log** allows clearing the logs of the concerned instance.
2. **Com.axelor.studio.bpm.service.job.ClearLogJob** is a batch job that allows clearing the logs.
3. When an instance is `completed` (no more tokens circulating in the instance), the logs are cleared.
