= Process Variables Visualization
:toc-title:

== Description

The process variables visualization feature allows users to view the variables associated with a running or completed process instance and their corresponding values. This is essential for debugging process execution, verifying data flow between tasks, and understanding the current state of a process.

== Access

To view process variables:

. Navigate to *Application Builder > BPM components > Technical Monitoring > Process Instances*
. Select a process instance from the list
. Open the *Variables* tab

== Variable Table

The variables tab displays a table with the following columns:

[cols="1,3", options="header"]
|===
| Column | Description

| *Name* (1)
| The technical name of the process variable. This corresponds to the variable names used in scripts, expressions, and action configurations throughout the process.

| *Value* (2)
| The current value of the variable, displayed as a string representation. For complex objects, this shows the serialized form.
|===

== Variable Types

Process variables can hold different types of data depending on how they were set during process execution:

- **String values**: Text data set by scripts or user input
- **Numeric values**: Integer or decimal values from calculations or field mappings
- **Boolean values**: True/false flags used in conditions and gateways
- **Object references**: References to Axelor records (displayed as serialized representations)
- **JSON data**: Structured data from custom model (MetaJsonModel) records
- **Collections**: Lists of values used in multi-instance activities or loop iterations

== Common Use Cases

=== Debugging Process Execution

When a process is stuck or behaving unexpectedly, check the variables tab to verify:

- Whether expected variables have been set correctly
- Whether condition variables have the expected true/false values
- Whether data passed between tasks is complete and accurate

=== Verifying Script Output

After a script task or action executes, verify the output by checking the variables tab. The variables set by `$response.setValue()` or `execution.setVariable()` calls are visible here.

=== Monitoring Data Flow

Track how data flows through the process by comparing variable values at different stages. This helps identify where data transformation or loss occurs.

[TIP]
====
Variable visualization is read-only. To modify process variables at runtime, use the xref:general-documentation/process-instance/process_instance_modification.adoc[Process Instance Modification] feature or execute a script through a service task.
====

== Technical Details

Process variables are visualized using the transient `WkfInstanceVariable` entity:

[cols="1,1,2", options="header"]
|===
| Field | Type | Description

| `name`
| String
| Variable name

| `value`
| Large String
| Variable value (serialized)
|===

This entity is non-persistent (transient) -- it exists only for display purposes. The actual variable data is stored in the Camunda process engine's runtime and history tables.
