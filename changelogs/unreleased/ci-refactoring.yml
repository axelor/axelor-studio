title: Refactor GitLab CI/CD configuration for better maintainability
type: change
description: |
  * Modularized CI/CD configuration into separate files (ci/base.gitlab-ci.yml and ci/aws.gitlab-ci.yml)
  * Removed dependency on external CI template from infrastructure/devops/aop-addons-ci
  * Updated to axelor/app-builder:7.2 base image
  * Improved Gradle cache configuration with more granular paths
  * Added explicit job dependencies for better pipeline visualization
  * Enabled merge request pipeline deployments for review environments

  Migration:
  * No action required - CI configuration is fully backward compatible
  * Custom CI extensions should now reference local CI files instead of external templates
