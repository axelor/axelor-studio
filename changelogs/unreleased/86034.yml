title: Add LinkScript feature
type: feature
description: |
  LinkScript is a library of chainable, multi-output, extendable, Groovy functions that can be created and assembled to run complex business logic in Axelor applications.
  
  The following property can be added to the webapp to be able to quickly call a LinkScript in any AOP's Groovy evaluated expression:
  context.ls = com.axelor.studio.ls.service.LinkScriptService
