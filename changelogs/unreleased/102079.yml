title: Integrate scripting policy security check
type: security
description: |
  configure scripting policy to control Java class access from Groovy/JavaScript scripts.
  - Replaced direct `AppSettingsStudioService` access with secure `ScriptAppSettingsStudioService` wrapper
  - Replaced direct `AppService` access with secure `ScriptAppService` wrapper
  - Removed `__beans__` binding from BPM scripts - use `__bean__(Class)` instead
  - Removed `__config__` binding in BPM scripts that exposed `AppSettings.get()` directly

  **IMPORTANT**: Its important to update the property to app.context use the secure wrapper:
  - Change from: `context.app = com.axelor.studio.app.service.AppService`
  - to: `context.app = com.axelor.studio.app.service.ScriptAppService`
