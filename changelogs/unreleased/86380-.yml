title: BPM Migration tool enhancement
type: feature
description: |
  Enhances the migration tool by adding a boolean option, "Migrate all instances of the previous version," 
  which ensures that all instances of the source Wkf model are first migrated to the latest version of the process definition 
  before migrating to the target Wkf model.
  The migration view is enhanced with useful information such as source and target model versions, the number of instances participating in the migration, 
  the number of successfully migrated instances, and the number of instances that failed migration due to errors.
