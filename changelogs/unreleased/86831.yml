title: Indicators in the “WkfModel” view are not visible to an admin user who does not have the exact name “admin”.
type: Fix
description: |
  Resolved issue where supervision elements in the “WkfModel” view were only visible to users with the exact code “admin.” 
  Introduced a new boolean field, isBpmAdministrator, on the User entity to designate BPM administrative privileges. 
  Ensure that supervision elements are accessible to all users configured as BPM administrators.
