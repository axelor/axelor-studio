title: Optimize Docker image for better security and smaller size
type: change
description: |
  * Switched runtime base image from tomcat:9.0-jre11-temurin to eclipse-temurin:11-jre-alpine for reduced image size
  * Updated builder image to axelor/app-builder:7.3
  * Manual Tomcat 9.0.85 installation for better version control
  * Enhanced security with automatic Alpine system upgrades
  * Improved runtime configuration with configurable environment variables
  * Standardized entrypoint location (/usr/local/bin instead of /bin)
  * Updated application source path to /app/axelor-public-webapp

  Migration:
  * If overriding Docker entrypoint, update path from /bin/docker-entrypoint.sh to /usr/local/bin/docker-entrypoint.sh
  * Base image is now Alpine-based - shell scripts should use sh-compatible syntax
