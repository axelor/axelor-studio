title: Fix inconsistency in MetaModel availability for Expression Builder across interfaces
type: fix
description: |
  This change addresses inconsistent behavior in the Expression Builder component when accessing MetaModels across different interfaces.
  
  The implementation now:
  - Refactors how models are fetched with a unified approach using `getModels` function
  - Adds proper filtering of models with `getModelFilter`
  - Includes an information tooltip to better guide users when selecting MetaModels not configured in process parameters
  
  These improvements ensure consistent behavior of the Expression Builder across all interfaces where it's being used, including BPMN components.
