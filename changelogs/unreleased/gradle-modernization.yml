title: Modernize Gradle build configuration
type: change
description: |
  * Migrated to modern Gradle plugins DSL syntax (plugins {} instead of buildscript {})
  * Centralized all dependency versions in gradle.properties for better maintainability
  * Replaced version.txt and version.gradle with gradle.properties moduleVersion property
  * Added Java toolchain configuration for consistent Java version management
  * Updated to Axelor app-builder 7.4 and AOP 7.4.5
  * Simplified repository configuration and removed redundant repository definitions

  Breaking Changes:
  * The version.txt and version.gradle files have been removed. Version is now managed via moduleVersion property in gradle.properties
  * The release script now reads version from gradle.properties instead of version.txt
  * Build configuration now uses Java toolchain - ensure JAVA_HOME or toolchain configuration is properly set
