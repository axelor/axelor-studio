title: New config for the non config app does not work
type: fix
description: |
  When adding a new configuration to an existing app without any previous configurations, the new configuration does not work.

  The code currently checks for the existence of a MetaModel. However, the MetaModel is not populated until a view reload is performed for the new model.
